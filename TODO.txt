[x] Add precommit checks - cpp, protobuf
[x] Make code base follow 'mage' namespace
[] Make gerrit use bot for github actions
[] Add way to create tickets for MAGE
[] Add clang-tidy check on github actions

A github action that runs on every addition to mage/**,
this would trigger other actions (which would give their labels 
on gerrit). Once all the invoked actions are complete and successfull
the parent action would give a verified +1 on the commit.
